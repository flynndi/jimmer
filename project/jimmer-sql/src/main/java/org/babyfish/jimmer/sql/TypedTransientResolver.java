/**
 * A specialized variant of {@link TransientResolver}. When conditions are appropriate, it will use
 * {@link #resolve(Collection, Context)} to provide an extra {@link Context} parameter, which supplies
 * the collection of entities currently being calculated, allowing access to other properties during calculation.
 * <p>
 * You need to implement both abstract {@code resolve} methods to ensure that when the {@link Context}
 * generation conditions are not met, it can fall back to the same behavior as {@link TransientResolver}.
 * <p>
 * {@link Context} may not be generated in scenarios where caching is configured.
 * <p>
 * This type is only for Java. If you use Kotlin, see {@code KTypedTransientResolver}.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: This type is experimental and may undergo major changes or be removed in future versions.
 *
 * @param <E>  The entity type
 * @param <ID> The id type of current entity
 * @param <V>  The calculated type, there are three possibilities
 *             <ul>
 *                <li>If the calculated property is NOT association,
 *                {@code V} should be the property type</li>
 *                <li>If the calculated property is associated reference,
 *                {@code V} should be the associated-id type</li>
 *                <li>If the calculated property is associated list,
 *                {@code V} should be the type of list whose elements
 *                are associated ids.</li>
 *             </ul>
